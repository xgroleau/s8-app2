#     Control task : drive-fuzzy
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script 'main.py' runs the TORCS engine in control mode, where control is performed client-side.
It provides a base implementation to integrate a fuzzy logic controller. 
Recordings of the episodes (sequences of observations/actions) for each track are stored in the 'recordings' directory.

Line 67 of main.py can be modified to use different controllers for each of the three control variables:

    controller = Controller(
            steeringController = FuzzySteeringControllerSugeno(),
            speedController = FuzzySpeedControllerSugenoV2(),
            gearController = FuzzyGearController()
            )

Each of the variables can be controlled via the FuzzyXController class or the SimpleXController class
the SimpleXController will simply use the code used in drive-simple for the specified variable. This allows
fine-tuning different controllers independently from one another.


The script 'gen-graphs.py' was used to overlap the same command curve from different runs.
Lines 16-21 can be modified to append the different files we wish to view while line 28 determines which curve is shown.
