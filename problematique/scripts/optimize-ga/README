#     Optimization task : optimize-ga
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script main.py is used to run the genetic algorithm.

The call to main() is paremetized according to how we want to run the GA.
The options 'fuelUsed' and 'topspeed' can be used to specify on what variable to optimize.

Other options can be set in parameters.py such as the number of bits used to represent every value as well as the valid ranges for each value.

At the end of an optimization, two graphs appear to show the evolution of the fitness over generations
as well as the evolution of the different parameters over time.
