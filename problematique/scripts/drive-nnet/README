# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script 'main.py' runs the TORCS engine in control mode, where control is performed client-side.
It provides a base implementation to integrate a neural network controller. 
Recordings of the episodes (sequences of observations/actions) for each track are stored in the 'recordings' directory.


The models uses the DriveSimple recordings in the data_set forlder as a training set.
To create the predictions, three neural networks are used, one for the gear,
one for the steering and one for the acceleration and brake.

By default the program will use the generated model, model_X.h5. To recreate 
new models, set the generate_models variable to True.

The program uses tensorboard to view the data. You can launch tensorboard using
"tensorboard --logdir ./logs/". You can then view the data at the address shown
by tensorboard.
